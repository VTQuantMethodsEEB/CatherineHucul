## Response to simulated predator presence

The data I’m planning to work with is predator behavior data collected
through last summer. Every song sparrow nest (NID) we found had a
raccoon (Pred A) and a beach ball (Pred B) presented to it. The recorded
data was collected over 6 different sites (3 rural, 3 urban) between 6am
and 9am; behaviors recorded for both male and female song sparrows and
consisted of low communication chips, high alarm chips, distance to the
ball, and latency to approach the raccoon/beach ball. Vocalizations can
range between 1 and 800 occurrences, distance is between 0 and 24
meters, and latency is still being added to the end of the dataset.

Here, I explored how to use R and did some basic calculations.
