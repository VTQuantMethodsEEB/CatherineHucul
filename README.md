## Response to simulated predator presence

The data I’m planning to work with is predator behavior data collected
through last summer. Every song sparrow nest (NID) we found had a
raccoon (Pred A) and a beach ball (Pred B) presented to it. The recorded
data was collected over 6 different sites (3 rural, 3 urban) between 6am
and 9am; behaviors recorded for both male and female song sparrows and
consisted of low communication chips, high alarm chips, distance to the
ball, and latency to approach the raccoon/beach ball. Vocalizations can
range between 1 and 800 occurrences, distance is between 0 and 24
meters, and latency is still being added to the end of the dataset.

## Week 1 – Intro to R

CODE : Hucul Assignment 1 DATA: pred_behav.csv

Copied and pasted from your example: Here, I explored how to use R and did some basic calculations.

## Week 2 + 3 - Data Manipulation and GitHub

Code: week3_CatherineHucul.R
Data: pred_behav.csv

examined data for mistakes, put data in tidy format (I think) mutate + summarise the data. Week 3 included a few ggplots using the data.
